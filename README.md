## 🎯 Why This Exists

Most reminder apps add stress:  
- Too many options  
- Endless snoozing  
- Cluttered interfaces  
- Requires internet or login  

For people with ADHD, **simplicity is support**.

SimpleMind removes decision fatigue and memory load by offering:
- One input box
- Four time buttons
- Full-screen alerts
- Zero distractions

It’s not just an app — it’s **cognitive scaffolding**.
